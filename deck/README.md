# Automation with decK

[decK](https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/latest/) ("declarative configuration of Kong") is a tool to manage Kong configuration as code using YAML files. You can use decK to complete the challenges. 

## Getting started

If not already done install `decK` on your machine following the instructions at [https://docs.konghq.com/deck/latest/installation/](https://docs.konghq.com/deck/latest/installation/).

Log in to [Konnect](https://cloud.konghq.com/), choose the Europan server (if not already selected by default) and create a token for automation. To do so click on the blue circle on the upper right with your initial and choose `Personal Access Tokens`. Create a new token and meomorize it (hint: put it into an environment variable on your machine).
