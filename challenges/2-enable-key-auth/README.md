# Challenge 2 - enable key authentication

The service create in [challenge 1](../1-proxy-service/README.md) is now exposed to the outside world. However, we want to secure it with an API key. This means that only requests that include a valid API key should be allowed to access the service.

Your challenge is to enable API key based authentication for the route you created in previous step.
