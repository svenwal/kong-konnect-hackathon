# Challenge 2 - enable key authentication

## Solution

In this folder there is a working example in the file [key-auth.yaml](./key-auth.yaml) which you can apply like this:

```shell
kubectl apply -f key-auth.yaml
```

ðŸš¨ remember to change all occurances of `xxxxxx-your-username` to your actual username like `johndoe` before applying the file
