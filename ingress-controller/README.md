# Using the ingress controller

The Kong Ingress Controller is already installed in the cluster. Please validate you have access to it using `kubectl get nodes` and let us know if you have any issues.

You can use the provided ingress resources in the `ingress-controller` directory to complete the challenges. You can apply the resources using `kubectl apply -f <resource-file>`.
